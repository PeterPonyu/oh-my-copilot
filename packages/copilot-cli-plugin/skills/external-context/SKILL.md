# External Context Skill

Fetch external documentation, references, and context for a query. Decomposes into 2-5 facets and spawns parallel document-specialist Claude agents.

## Usage

```
/omcp:external-context <topic or question>
```

### Examples

```
/omcp:external-context What are the best practices for JWT token rotation in Node.js?
/omcp:external-context Compare Prisma vs Drizzle ORM for PostgreSQL
/omcp:external-context Latest React Server Components patterns and conventions
```

## Protocol

### Step 1: Facet Decomposition

Given a query, decompose into 2-5 independent search facets:

```markdown
## Search Decomposition

**Query:** <original query>

### Facet 1: <facet-name>
- **Search focus:** What to search for
- **Sources:** Official docs, GitHub, blogs, etc.

### Facet 2: <facet-name>
...
```

### Step 2: Parallel Agent Invocation

Fire independent facets in parallel via Task tool:

```
[Delegate to the document-specialist agent]


[Delegate to the document-specialist agent]

```

Maximum 5 parallel document-specialist agents.

### Step 3: Synthesis Output Format

Present synthesized results in this format:

```markdown
## External Context: <query>

### Key Findings
1. **<finding>** - Source: [title](url)
2. **<finding>** - Source: [title](url)

### Detailed Results

#### Facet 1: <name>
<aggregated findings with citations>

#### Facet 2: <name>
<aggregated findings with citations>

### Sources
- [Source 1](url)
- [Source 2](url)
```

## Configuration

- Maximum 5 parallel document-specialist agents
- No magic keyword trigger - explicit invocation only
